//! Native rapira extension contract.
//!
//! An extension is a standalone crate — its own repository, compiled into rapira — that
//! **drives PHP**: its async [`Extension::run`] reaches rapira's PHP worker pool through
//! [`Php`]. The host constructs it ([`Extension::init`]), drives `run`, and asks it to
//! stop with [`Extension::shutdown`].
